✸ Webkeeper

Some person scampering around Turtle Island. I am dedicated to silly and serious tools and interactions for introspection, connection, and solidarity.

Consider this website a sandwichboard that advertises\* my latest notes, happenings about town, and other such miscellany.

- Quick links: scattered navelgazing + what I'm up to now + a guestbook.
  ❦ Dandelion

The dandelion section on my website comprises loosely remembered networks of people I am thankful for, inspired by, and want to acknowledge, among others not listed.
