# What makes personality scary?

I’ve noticed recently that I sometimes find myself a little afraid of people’s personalities. It’s kind of a weird experience: it makes sense to be afraid of people and other things that can hurt you, but being afraid of a personality? It doesn’t make a lot of sense. Personalities can seem quirky or interesting, but scary?
