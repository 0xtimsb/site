title: redundant tasks
date: 2024-08-01

i find myself doing the same tasks over and over againâ€”working with git, editing text, moving windows around, opening and closing stuff.
i want to automate them. well, unless i get a chip inside my brain that tells the computer what to do, i have to use keyboard shortcuts.

below are my keybindings for some common tasks i do on daily basis.

## for window management:

i use sway and stick with the default keybindings that come with it. i find them sensible.

## for text editing:

i use vscode with vim extensions to make text manipulation easier. i might switch to zed in the future.

## for git:

i use the vscode terminal and these keybindings.

- `cmd + g c` to checkout branch
- `cmd + g space` to commit
- `cmd + g n` to create new branch
- `cmd + g d` to discard all changes
- `cmd + g f` to fetch from all remotes
- `cmd + g m` to merge branch
- `cmd + g l` to pop latest stash
- `cmd + g shift + p` to pull changes
- `cmd + g p` to push changes
- `cmd + g s` to stash changes
- `cmd + g u` to undo last commit
