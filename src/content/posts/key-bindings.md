## for window manager:

i mostly use default key that comes with sway.

## for git:

i have vscode key bindings for this use case as i mostly use vscode terminal.

but can be configure on any terminal or nvim. i might do that in future.

- `cmd + g c` to checkout branch
- `cmd + g space` to commit
- `cmd + g n` to create new branch
- `cmd + g d` to discard all changes
- `cmd + g f` to fetch from all remotes
- `cmd + g m` to merge branch
- `cmd + g l` to pop latest stash
- `cmd + g shift + p` to pull changes
- `cmd + g p` to push changes
- `cmd + g s` to stash changes
- `cmd + g u` to undo last commit
