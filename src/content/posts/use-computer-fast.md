# how to use computer fast?

use shortcuts. i mean everywhere.

## 1. for window management:

this needs to be upated as per my i3 config. these are old macos shortcuts.

- `opt + h,j,k,l` to focus windows
- `opt + shift + h,j,k,l` to move windows
- `opt + number` to switch to workspace
- `opt + shift + number` to move window to workspace

## 2. for text editing:

at work, my most time is spent on vscode. i use [vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) extension to use vim key bindings.

> i'm gonna update vim motions i use here soon

## 3. for git:

terminal isn't the fastest way to do git operations as you do these operations daily. i have vscode key bindings for these use cases.

- `cmd + g p` to push changes
- `cmd + g shift + p` to pull changes
- `cmd + g s` to stash changes
- `cmd + g l` to pop last stash
- `cmd + g u` to undo last commit
- `cmd + g space` to commit staged changes
- `cmd + g c` to checkout branch
- `cmd + g m` to merge branch
- `cmd + g d` to discard changes
